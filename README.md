## `Background and Overview`  
  For non-native speakers, prepping for interviews or speaking with someone in English is difficult and some people will feel shy.

  Enspire is a website which records and stores user responses to general interview questions and helps users improve communication by  correcting their mistakes. Logged in users can check their performance by clicking each category

## Functionality & MVP List
1. __User Authentication__
    - New users can sign up
    - Returning users can log in and log out
    - Demo login available
    - Users are not allowed to use certain features without logging in
2. __Submit Data__
    - Users can submit data to backend (transcripts or speech-to-text)
    - Link with Microsoft Azure
    - Store the analyzed data to the database
3. __Response__
    - Can open task to input data
    - Can see the corrected answers with grammar mistakes highlighted
4. __Performance Graph__
